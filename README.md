# Dynamic YouTube Comments Scraping


## Citation & Source of my code
Declare: My code is adapted from Dat Do's Github folder "Scraping-Youtube-Comments", you can check it out at https://github.com/dddat1017/Scraping-Youtube-Comments.
Thanks Dat Do for sharing a Python code. I modified this script by adding an interactive way to scroll down the video page and get as many comments as possible. This script is published for study and research exploration purpose only, and it would not be used for any commercial purpose.
